# RecipeApp-python-
A 4th semester python project on RecipeApp.

Here we have used a free API ( https://forkify-api.herokuapp.com/ ).
It provides two method search and get to load data in .json format.

We have used a spell Checker package from here : https://github.com/fsondej/autocorrect
You can install it using command : pip install autocorrect
